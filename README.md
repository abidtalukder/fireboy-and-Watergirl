# Abid Talukder Dev Logs

May 24, 2022 - Abid Branch
I worked on making the Moveable class skeleton, which is the super class of Platform.

May 30, 2022 - Abid-1
I created an extension of Vansh's branch, and I made the methods for box. This includes seeing if box touches player, if box touches buttons, checkingboundaries, adjusting speed, and moving around the map. Basically the physics, constructors, and main requirements for box.

I had extra features for players interacting with boxes so that boxes move when they collide with players, and that players can stand on boxes. I created the elevator class, and made it move up and down.

Jun 1, 2022 - Abid-1

I worked on the Moveable class so that it was a true superclass to Character. It held features for colliding with other interactable objects in the game. I started the enemy class and made methods for its constructors, display, and movement.

Jun 2, 2022 - Abid-1

I focused on some bug fixes for enemies that allowed them to properly jump over boxes, and reset the game if players touched them. Players bounce and kill enemies when they step on top of them.

Jun 3, 2022 - Abid-1

I put a method for characters to detect collisions with enemies.

Jun 7, 2022 - Abid-1

I created the map and MapContainer class, which would arrange the screen into a grid where different objects could be placed. I fixed an issue where characters couldn't stand on boxes.
